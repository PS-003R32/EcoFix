> **"Don't toss it. Fix it."** > EcoFix is a multimodal AI assistant that turns anyone into a repair technician. Powered by Google's **Gemini 3 Flash**, it diagnoses broken electronics via live video, voice, and images, calculating real-time e-waste diversion metrics to gamify sustainability.

## Features

### 1. Multimodal Diagnosis (Gemini 3)
Upload an image or use the **Live Vision Camera** to show EcoFix the problem. The AI analyzes visual data instantly to identify the device and the damage.

### 2. Voice-First Interaction
Hands busy with a screwdriver? No problem. Use the **integrated microphone** to speak to EcoFix naturally. It fuses your voice context ("The fan is making a grinding noise") with the visual data for a precise diagnosis.

### 3. The Impact Engine
EcoFix gamifies sustainability by calculating:
* **E-Waste Diverted:** The actual weight of the device kept out of a landfill (e.g., *0.18 kg* for a smartphone).
* **Wealth Saved:** The estimated difference between the repair cost and buying a new unit.
